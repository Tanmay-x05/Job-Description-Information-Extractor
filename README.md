Job Description Information Extractor is an NLP-driven system designed to automatically identify and extract structured information from unstructured job-related text such as job descriptions, resumes, and professional profiles. The system focuses on extracting skills (technical and soft), role requirements, and salary-related information by combining text preprocessing, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and machine learning models such as spaCy and BERT. It produces accurate, structured outputs in formats like CSV and JSON, enabling applications in recruitment automation, job–skill matching, skill gap analysis, and workforce analytics. The project emphasizes accuracy and robustness, making it suitable for real-world HR and job market analysis use cases.
